// -------------------------------------------------------
// Assignment 2
// Written by: Matthew Da Silva - 40008582
// For COMP 248 Section EE â€“ Fall 2018
//
// Assignment 2 can be broken down into 2 parts. Part 1 is a 
// language assessment program which prompts the user to enter
// marks for key language skills. The output is a response based 
// on the condition that their marks satisfy. Part 1 deals primarily 
// with nested IF statements.
// Part 2 is a program that gets user input (max 7 digits), sums each 
// digit together and finds all possible divisors of that sum. The program then 
// asks the user if they would like to use the program again. If "Yes" is 
// answered, it repeats. If "No" is answered, the program goes into its ending phase.
// Part 2 primarily deals with loops, along with IF statements.
//
//			**********NOTE**********
// PART 1 AND 2 ARE WITHIN THE SAME PUBLIC CLASS (Assignment 2). PLEASE USE MULTI-LINE
// CUTS WHERE PROMPTED/WHERE ALREADY PRESENT.
